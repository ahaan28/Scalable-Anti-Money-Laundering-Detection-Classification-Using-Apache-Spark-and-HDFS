Money laundering poses a significant threat to global financial systems by disguising illicit funds as legitimate transactions. This project develops a scalable anti-money laundering (AML) detection system using Apache Spark and Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) to analyze a large financial transaction dataset. Stored on HDFS, the dataset encompasses diverse payment types, currencies, and geographic regions, with challenges such as severe class imbalance due to the rarity of fraudulent transactions. Utilizing PySpark, the project implements a machine learning pipeline that addresses these issues through feature engineering, generating temporal, behavioral, and geographic risk indicators like cross-border flags and sender activity patterns. A custom Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is applied to balance the dataset, improving model sensitivity to fraud. Multiple machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient-Boosted Trees, Naive Bayes, Linear SVM, and Multilayer Perceptron, are trained and evaluated, with a retrained Decision Tree yielding superior performance. The pipeline leverages Sparkâ€™s distributed processing for scalability, ensuring adaptability to larger datasets. Visualizations, such as confusion matrices, underscore model effectiveness. This work delivers a robust, scalable AML solution that minimizes false negatives, supports regulatory compliance, and provides financial institutions with a blueprint for big data-driven fraud detection in the digital economy.
